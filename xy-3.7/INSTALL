---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-2- OVERVIEW OF FILES AND WHERE THEY SHOULD BE INSTALLED
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


In this section we explain in 11 steps where the different groups of
Xy-pic files in the `run' and `doc' distribution should be installed.
For each file category we indicate the location recommended by TDS,
the TeX Directory Standard (as formed by a TUG working group of that
name).

IMPORTANT
---------
If you have users currently using version 2.6 then make sure you read
section 4!  Please also check the next section for any system specific
considerations.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS
------------------
Installing the Xy-pic package requires almost 1MB with the macros
macros taking up most of the space.  Installing everything, including
sources, documentation in both DVI, DVIPS, and PS, form, as well as
bitmap fonts for several printers and in PostScript Type1 form,
requires more than 12MB.


Step 1. Eliminating Obsolete Files
----------------------------------
The new PostScript Type1 fonts contributed by Y&Y Inc. require that
you REMOVE ALL COPIES of the following files BEFORE installing:

Old font map files should be removed:

  xy.map
  xypic.map

TDS directory: texmf/dvips/xypic

Also be aware that some installations, for example the TeX Live 2
CD-ROM, insert the contents of map files in `psfonts.map' (with TDS
directory texmf/dvips/base); then you must EDIT it to remove all lines
that start with `xy'.

Remove old PostScript Type1 font files:

  xyatip10.pfa
  xybsql10.pfa
  xybtip10.pfa
  xycirc10.pfa
  xycmat10.pfa
  xycmbt10.pfa
  xydash10.pfa
  xyeuat10.pfa
  xyeubt10.pfa

  xyatip10.pfb
  xybsql10.pfb
  xybtip10.pfb
  xycirc10.pfb
  xycmat10.pfb
  xycmbt10.pfb
  xydash10.pfb
  xyeuat10.pfb
  xyeubt10.pfb

TDS directory: texmf/fonts/type1/public/xypic

Remove old `xy.sty' and `xypic.sty' files that you might have stored
earlier in the TDS directory `texmf/tex/latex/misc'.


[FILES IN xy*run.tar.gz:]


Step 2. Availability & License
------------------------------
These eight files contain general information and should be installed
in a publicly readable place:

  README	generic information on Xy-pic
  CATALOG	version information and summary
  TRAILER	announcement and availability
  INSTALL	how to install (this file)
  MANIFEST	list of all files
  VERSIONS	the RCS version ids of all source files
  COPYING	GNU General Public License

TDS directory: texmf/doc/generic/xypic


Step 3. Macros
--------------
Files `texinputs/*' are TeX and LaTeX macro files that must be
installed in a place which TeX and LaTeX will search (e.g., with un*x
TeX, a directory users include in the TEXINPUTS environment variable).

The files `texinputs/*.ini' 

TDS directory: texmf/tex/generic/xypic


Step 4. TeX Font Metric
-----------------------
Files `texfonts/*.tfm' should be installed in a directory that TeX
will search for fonts (e.g., with un*x TeX, a directory users include
in the TEXFONTS environment variable).

TDS directory: texmf/fonts/tfm/public/xypic


Step 5. METAFONT Sources
------------------------
Files `mfinputs/*.mf' should be installed in some directory where the
METAFONT program will search for them (e.g., with un*x TeX, a
directory included in the MFINPUTS environment variable).

NOTE: The METAFONT source files are only useful on installations where
the printer driver and previewer can utilise them to generate the
required bitmap fonts `on-line'.  If this is possible on your
installation then please use it: it saves substantial amounts of space
and means that you will automatically use fonts optimised for each
printer (provided evrything is correctly set up, of course).

TDS directory: texmf/fonts/source/public/xypic


Step 6. Bitmap Fonts [Optional]
-------------------------------
Files matching the patterns `pkfonts/cx<N>/*.<N>pk' and
`pkfonts/ljfour<N>/*.<N>pk', where <N> is some number, contain bitmap
font files and should be installed where DVI previewers and printer
drivers will find them (e.g., with un*x, the `xdvi' program should see
them through the XDVIFONTS environment variable).  (`cx' is a 300 dpi
(dots per inch) mode and `ljfour' a 600 dpi mode.)

NOTE: This step is optional because the bitmaps are only needed (and
only recommended) for installations that can't use the METAFONT
sources directly but do have a 300 or 600 dpi laserprinter driver that
accepts PK bitmap font files.

TDS directory: texmf/fonts/pk/cx/public/xypic/dpi<N>
          and: texmf/fonts/pk/ljfour/public/xypic<N>


Step 7. PostScript Type1 Fonts
------------------------------
Files `type1/*.pfb' contain versions of the Xy-pic fonts in special
PostScript form that may be useful on some installations.  They should
be installed where the applications using them look for such fonts (if
used with DVIPS then the `ps/xypic.map' file from the next group
should also be installed).

NOTE: Some installations, notably teTeX 0.4, will PREFER using these
fonts over the METAFONT-generated equivalents (IMHO this is a bug in
the MakeTeXPK script).  On those systems we recommend that you ALSO
install the PK fonts to circumvent the problem.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you do not have any old Xy-pic PostScript
`xy*.pfa' fonts floating around in your system - search for and remove
all files named `xy*.pfa' when you have installed the new fonts.  One
common way old (and wrong) fonts is manifest is when some arrowheads
appear skewed or too thin.

TDS directory: texmf/fonts/type1/public/xypic


Step 8. Adobe Font Metric Files
-------------------------------
Files `afm/*.afm' are special files for the Adobe Type Manager and
some other software.  Install them if you need them.

TDS directory (usually): texmf/fonts/afm/public/xypic


Step 9. PostScript Font Metric Files
------------------------------------
Files `pfm/*.pfm' are special files for the Windows version of the
Adobe Type Manager and some other software.  Install them if you need
them.

TDS directory (usually): texmf/fonts/pfm/public/xypic


Step 10. PostScript Header Files
--------------------------------
Files `ps/*' contain PostScript header files.  If you plan to use the
PostScript extension option then you should copy these files to a
place where your PostScript DVI driver will find them.

NOTE: For older versions of DVIPS (at least for 5.58f) you should
replace the occurrences of `<<' with `<' in `xypic.map'.

TDS directory (usually): texmf/dvips/xypic


[FILES IN xy*doc.tar.gz:]


Step 11. Manuals
----------------
The typeset User's Guide is distributed as a DVI file which you should
be able to print (or preview) once you have installed the fonts (as
source or bitmaps as applicable for your system):

  doc/xyguide.dvi	User's Guide, typeset using the kernel Xy-pic fonts
  doc/xyguide.dvips	--- using DVIPS specific `specials'
  doc/xyguide.ps	--- in PostScript (with 600dpi bitmap fonts)

Similarly, the reference manual for the kernel and the distributed
options is included in the same format:

  doc/xyrefer.dvi	Reference Manual, using Xy-pic fonts
  doc/xyrefer.dvips	--- using DVIPS specific `specials'
  doc/xyrefer.ps	--- in PostScript (with 600dpi bitmap fonts)

Notice that only the .dvi documents are portable among all TeX
installations.

TDS directory: texmf/doc/generic/xypic


That's all.  If you want to install the Xy-pic sources (to experiment
with development, for example), you need to get the separate
distribution `xy*src.tar.gz'.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-3- INFORMATION FOR SPECIFIC SYSTEMS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


UN*X
----
The above installation procedure (using the TDS recommended places) is
encoded in the script `support/install-tds': the command

  ./support/install-tds <texmf>

where <texmf> is the full path name of the `texmf' directory (the root
of the TDS tree), will install all the Xy-pic runtime files (or more
precisely: it will perform steps 2-5 and 7-10 above).

NOTE: You must MANUALLY remove obsolete files (do step 1 above)!

If you get the source distribution as described in `TRAILER' and
change the configuration section of the provided `src/Makefile' to
reflect your local file system conventions as described in
`src/MAKE', then the command

  make TEXMF=<texmf> install

will also do this (but with the generated files, of course).


VMS
---
(Mon, 20 Mar 1995; thanks to Austin Benson <austin@shapel.ug.eds.com>
and Ralf Gaertner <gaertner@cthulhu.rhein-main.de>):

(1) VMS tfm and pk files are in a funny file format, which means they
    EITHER should be generated from the mf source on a VMS machine, OR
    be converted by a conversion program such as BILF (part of the
    DECUS TeX distribution and the ZOO distribution although the
    latter is reported to only work on VAXen).

    FIX: Install .mf sources and pregenerate .tfm and .pk files
    manually OR convert with BILF or a similar program.

(2) At least some (OLD) versions of TeX for VMS had a `buglet' to do
    with searching for input files: if you go \input <filename> on VMS
    then TeX prepends the filename with a chained logical
    "tex_inputs:" - equivalent to a Unix path. Unfortunately \openin
    does _not_ do this - although on Unix systems \openin will search
    the TEXINPUTS path just as \input does.

    FIX: Change the following line in xy.tex

\xydef@\xyinputorelse@@#1#2{\openin\xyread@=#1

    TO

\xydef@\xyinputorelse@@#1#2{\openin\xyread@=tex_inputs:#1


PC WITH PCTEX
-------------
On PCTeX fonts should be stored in files `C:\PIXEL\DPI<dpi>\<font>.pk'
where <dpi> and <font> are replaced by appropriate values, e.g., `600'
and `xyatip' (thanks to Alain Amiouni <alain_amiouni@msn.com>).


MAC WITH Textures or OzTeX
--------------------------
See the special files `INSTALL.Textures' and `INSTALL.OzTeX'.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-4- UPDATING FROM VERSION 2.6 (AND EARLIER)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: If you have installed release 3.* or 2.7-2.12 then you can
skip this section. If you have not, and use version 2.6, then READ IT!

Xy-pic release 2.7 was almost a complete rewrite of Xy-pic; later
releases are updates to this version.  If you are using version 2.6 (or
some earlier version) then note the following:

* All the fonts have been redone AND renamed (except two that have not
  changed).  Thus installing version 3 will not break any DVI files
  you already have that were typeset using the old fonts.

  NOTE: In fact the distribution still contains the old fonts but only
  as METAFONT sources, TFM font metrics, and PK bitmaps.

* The distribution contains new versions of the files `xypic.tex' and
  `xypic.sty' that load Xy-pic in a special compatibility mode.  Thus
  retypesetting your documents will create DVI files using the new
  fonts.  If you wish to keep the old `xypic.tex' and `xypic.sty' then
  you should rename them before installation; we suggest naming them
  `xypic-2.tex' and `xypic-2.sty' and REMEMBER to change the line
  `\input xypic' in `xypic-2.sty' to `\input xypic-2' !

* There are a few points where the backwards compatibility is not
  perfect -- these are noted in the documentation.
